# CC Developer Helper

This is a set of two extensions for Adobe Premiere Pro and Google Chrome which
enables one click debug process start.

## Environment

You can easily integrate tools with any IDE or editor. Premiere plugin has an
http interface for starting the whole process. I personally uses Ant build
script where I call particular url with curl.
